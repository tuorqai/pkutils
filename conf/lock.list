# pkexpr format:
# package-name~arch=version!tag@repo:series

# Examples:
#
# -- you can lock all kernel packages:
# kernel-.*
# -- or do it by version:
# =4\.4\.157
#
# -- escape special regex characters, especially '+' and '.':
# gcc-g\+\+
# bash=4\.3\.046

#
# WARNING: there is no sense to blacklist by repo or package series,
# since all locally installed packages have 'local' repository ID
# and 'unknown' series. You can check it out by locking '@local'
# (you'll find out that all packages are locked).
#
# Package locking affects only already installed packages.
